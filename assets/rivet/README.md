This directory currently contains only Rivet analyses generated by the UTK group.  These were tested on PYTHIA Angantyr and use the centrality class developed by Antonio Da Silva.  This centrality class ideally would be approved as well.  This is a work in progress and discussions about the appropriate implementation for things such as centrality is still required.
