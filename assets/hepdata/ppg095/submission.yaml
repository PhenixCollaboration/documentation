  BNL-RHIC.  Correlations of charged hadrons of 1< pT<10 Gev/cwith highpTdirect photons andπ0mesonsin the range 5< pT<15 Gev/care used to study jet fragmentation in theγ+jet and dijet channels,respectively. The magnitude of the partonic transverse momentum,kT, is obtained by comparingto a model incorporating a GaussiankTsmearing. The sensitivity of the associated charged hadronspectra to the underlying fragmentation function is testedand the data are compared to calculationsusing recent global fit results. The shape of the direct photon-associated hadron spectrum as well asits charge asymmetry are found to be consistent with a sampledominated by quark-gluon Comptonscattering. No significant evidence of fragmentation photon correlated production is observed withinexperimental uncertainties.
