NOTE: the data tables are updated on 12/07/2006. They are the same one as in
the final figure in the paper published in PRL.
<P></P>
In comparison with the original original data table (version 1) there are
two very small changes.
<br>
1) In low pT, the systematic errors are reduced slightly after error propagation is done more properly.
<br>
2) At high pT, we now take into account the pT dependence of the probability of internal conversion of direct photons. This increases the cocktail by a very small amount in high pT. The change in heavy-flavor electron cross section is less than a percent for most of the momentum range.
