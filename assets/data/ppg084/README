Data tables for the PHENIX paper

"Onset of $\pi^0$ Suppression Studied in Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 22.4, 62.4, and 200~GeV"

The data points for each figure can be found in the
file(s) Fig*.tex. 

In addition, we provide data tables for R_AA vs. pT
for further centrality classes. In these files (raa*.tex) 
the errors are subdivided in different types. 
The quoted errors (Type A,B,C) correspond to: 
- A: Point-to-Point not correlated errors (mainly statistical) 
- B: Point-to-Point correlated errors (e.g. energy scale) 
- C: Globally correlated errors which move the points by a multiplicative 
factor (mainly uncertainty in T_AB and in the p+p normalization)
