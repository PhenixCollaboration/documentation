1) there is an error in the labelling of figure 12 and 18, there is no d\Delta\phi in the Yaxis label. 
The yield has been integrated in the respective Dphi window.
2) In the discussion of Figure9, I forget to mention one constrains used in the fit. I require that 
the xi (ratio of fg to event normalized bacground ) has to be >= 1. This has been mentioned briefly 
in the end of section III.E but I forget to mention it again here. So the fit is not a free fit.
