Data Table for Correlation Functions defined according to equation 8 of Phys.Rev.C78:014901,2008 (0801.4545) for various centality bin: 
0-5%, 5-10%, 10-15%, 15-20%, 0-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-92%
0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-92%, 0-92%

1) The file for each centrality bin contains the \Delta\phi distributions for various pTa and pTb combinations

2) For each pT bin, the corresponding trigger and partner v2 values and pedestal level are also included (only statistical error are included)

3) The corresponding plot for the correlation function are saved in png and eps directory.
