o  nnref.txt contains the N + N reference from Analysis note 193.

  the reference is for h^{+} + h^{-}, it is parameterized as:
  double axelfunpaper(double *x,double *par){
    double y1,y2,sc;
    // sc = 1.587;
    sc = 1.581;
    y1 = 2*386/42.2/pow(1+x[0]/1.219,9.99);
    y2 =1;
    if(x[0]<1.586){
     y2 = (1.581-0.28*(1.586-x[0])*(1.586-x[0]))/1.581;
    }
    double fitted = y1*y2*sc;
    return fitted;
  }
  This function is effective a 1/(2\pi p_{T})dN/dp_{T}d\eta. 
  and can be directly used to derive the Raa.
  In note 193, the author also gives an upper and lower band which bracket the 
  systematic error on the referece.

  the upper band can be calculated as:
  double fun1(double *x, double *par){
   double tmp1 = 1.151-0.00409*x[0]-0.00174*x[0]*x[0]+0.000383*x[0]*x[0]*x[0];
   double tmp2 = sqrt((tmp1-1)*(tmp1-1)-0.104*0.104-0.05*0.05);
   double tmp3 = sqrt(tmp2*tmp2+0.1*0.1/1.7/1.7);
   v[0] = tmp2;//fit to pi0
   v[1] = 0.1/1.7;//h/pi
   v[2] = sqrt(tmp3*tmp3+0.104*0.104);//total error
   return tmp3;
 }

  the lower band can be calculated as:
 double fun2(double *x, double *par){
  double tmp1 = 0.894-0.00368*x[0]+0.00059*x[0]*x[0]-0.000112*x[0]*x[0]*x[0];
  double tmp2 = sqrt((1-1/tmp1)*(1-1/tmp1)-0.104*0.104-0.05*0.05);
  double tmp3;
  if(x[0]>2.866){
    tmp3 = 0.1;
  }else if(x[0]>1.586){
    double a = 1.581/
      (1.437-0.091*(2.866-x[0])*(2.866-x[0]));
    tmp3 = 1-1/a;
  }else{
    double a = (1.581-0.28*(1.586-x[0])*(1.586-x[0]))/
      (1.437-0.091*(2.866-x[0])*(2.866-x[0]));
    tmp3 = 1-1/a;
  }
  double tmp = sqrt(tmp2*tmp2+tmp3*tmp3/1.7/1.7);
  v[0] = tmp2;
  v[1] = tmp3/1.7;
  v[2] = sqrt(tmp*tmp+0.104*0.104);
  return tmp;
 }

  the resulting reference is in nnref.txt
  pT    is the transverse momentum.
  yield is reference cross section divided by 42.2. Such that it corresponds to
  (h^{+} + h^{-})/2 spectra per event.
  ppnorm is the 9.6%\oplus4% error on pp references
  fitlow_e/fitup_e is the lower/upper error band in percentage for the fit on pp pi0 data and taken out the 5% point to point error
  hpilow_e/hpiup_e is the lower/upper error band on percentage for the h/pi ratio.(we have divide by 1.7 to get 1 sigma error
  low_e/up_e is lower/upper total error band

o Raa_x_x.txt is Raa for charged hadron for various centrality.
  from left to right, the columes are:
  1). pT
  2). Raa
  3). statistical error from AuAu
  4). Upper bound of the systematic error in percentage
  5). Lower bound of the systematic error in percentage
    (note: the error includes the N+N reference error and AuAu systmatic errors 
     and occupancy error added in quadrature) 
  6). Error from pp parametrization that is not pT dependendent. 
     This error is not included in the calculation of 4) and 5).
  7). Error on number of binary collisions.

o.  Raapi0_x_x.txt is the Raa used from pi0 analysis.
   I think David already take out the 10.6 nomalization error from pp.
